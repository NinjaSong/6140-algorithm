For the convenience of drawing QRTD and SQD, the outputs used for QRTD are different from the outputs for single run. 
1. The first column represents the seed number;
2. For each seed, the following two columns represent the Result and Time seperatedly under each iteration;
3. Please note that for results used for the QRTD plot, the seeds only represent the number of runs.
Note: in order to generate a much more randomed order, for each run, I initialized the first order by swapping the nodes 100 times.
