For the convenience of drawing box plot, the outputs used for boxplot are different from the output for single run. 
1. There are totally 50 runs have been processed to produce the data for Boxplot;
2. For each line, the line number represents the number of run. The first value represents the best solution was found for this run.
   The third line represents the total running time for this run;
3. By using this information, I generated the box plot in the report. 
Note: in order to generate a much more randomed order, for each run, I initialized the first order by swapping the nodes 100 times.
